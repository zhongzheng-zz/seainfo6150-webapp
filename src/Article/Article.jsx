      <p>The Statue of Liberty's original torch is getting a new home.</p>

      <p>
        Made of copper and gold so that it would shine bright, the first torch took a beating from the weather and was replaced by a replica<br/>
        in 1984. It's been stored in the statue's pedestal ever since.
      </p>

      <p>
        But visitors will be able to see the original 3,600-pound torch in all its glory at a new Statue of Liberty Museum, which will open<br/>
        on Liberty Island in May 2019. The torch was transported there by truck last week, along with a replica model of Lady Liberty's<br/>
        face.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Although it is not one of the most difficult things we have ever moved," says Douglas Phelps, who oversaw the relocation of the<br/> 
        torch, "it is certainly the most important."
      </p>

      <h2>The history of the Statue of Liberty</h2>

      <p>Not only is the Statue of Liberty the symbol of New York City, she is also a UNESCO World Heritage site under the designation of <br/>
         <i>Outstanding Universal Value.</i>
      </p>

      <p>Her full name is Liberty Enlightening the World, and she was designed by Frederic Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel -- <br/>
         yes, the same guy who built Paris's Eiffel Tower.
      </p>
      <p>Lady Liberty was a gift from France to the United States to celebrate the centennial of their nation's independence -- although,<br/>
         somewhat awkwardly, she arrived a decade too late. Nevertheless, President Grover Cleveland formally unveiled her in 1886.
      </p>
      <p>Since then, the statue has served as a symbol of hope and possibility for many people who entered the United States as immigrants <br/>
         via neighboring Ellis Island.
      </p>
      <p>"The original torch is a beautiful object of art and exemplifies the American ideals of freedom and democracy," says John<br/>
         Piltzecker, superintendent of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. That symbolic spirit inspired the decision to inscribe these<br/> 
         famous lines on the statue's pedestal:</p> 
         <blockquote>Give me your tired, your poor<br/>
         Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.
         </blockquote>   
      <p>
        In 2017, nearly 4.5 million people visited Liberty Island.
      </p>
      <p>
         When completed, the Statue of Liberty Museum will be 26,000 square feet of history, inspiration and deeper analysis of the statue's <br/>
         symbolism both in the US and around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inspiration gallery, which is where the torch will live, will have floor-to-ceiling glass windows looking out at Lower <br/>
        Manhattan, including the World Trade Center.
